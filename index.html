    <h2>Czech Republic</h2>
    <p>
      country located in central Europe. It comprises the historical provinces
      of Bohemia and Moravia along with the southern tip of Silesia,
      collectively often called the Czech Lands. In 2016 the country adopted the
      name “Czechia” as a shortened, informal name for the Czech Republic.

      Despite its landlocked location, there were brief periods in the Middle
      Ages during which Bohemia had access to the Baltic and Adriatic
      seacoasts—which no doubt was on William Shakespeare’s mind when he set
      much of his play The Winter’s Tale there. A region of rolling hills and
      mountains, Bohemia is dominated by the national capital, Prague. Set on
      the Vltava River, this picturesque city of bridges and spires is the
      unique work of generations of artists brought in by the rulers of Bohemia.
      Perhaps only the French are as focused on their capital, Paris, as the
      Czechs are on theirs; of the two, Prague has a more magical quality for
      many. Called “the handsomest city of Europe” since the 18th century, it
      has intoxicated writers, poets, and musicians alike. While Prague was the
      birthplace of the writer Franz Kafka and the poet Rainer Maria Rilke,
      Brno, Moravia’s largest city, was the site of Gregor Mendel’s
      groundbreaking genetic experiments in the 19th century and the birthplace
      of contemporary novelist Milan Kundera. Moravians are as proud of their
      vineyards and wine as Bohemians are of their breweries and the Pilsner
      beer that originated in the town of Plzeň (Pilsen), which is also noted as
      the site of the Škoda Works—a heavy industrial complex that originated
      with the Habsburg monarchy. Moravia was equally endowed with skilled
      labour, which helped make Brno into one of the leading industrial towns in
      textiles and engineering during the 19th century and Ostrava, in the
      north, into a major coal-mining region, thanks to the vast fossil fuel
      deposits stretching over from Silesia.

        Zlín, the administrative center of the Zlín region, lies along the river
        Dřevnice in a mild climatic area of southeastern Moravia. It is also a
        crossroad for the ethnographic boundaries of the Wallachian, Hana and
        Moravian Slovak regions. This region of 590,000 inhabitants became
        famous for more reasons than its advantageous location. The city is
        famous as the birthplace of the founder of the colossal Bata Shoe
        Empire, Thomas Bata, where his company flourished in the first half of
        the 20th century. One facet of the city's character is its one-of-a-kind
        functionalist architecture. In 2001 a new university the Thomas Bata
        University was founded in Zlín. The city is the seat for several
        government centers, as well as for cultural and social institutions.
        Zlín holds many meaningful congresses, mainly in medical professions.
        New constructions, restored façades and streets all give the visitor a
        refreshing first impression of the city. The Dřevnice River Valley,
        across which Zlín spreads out, is lush and green. Just walking through
        the city is an unforgettable experience. Those who truly know Zlín also
        know why it has fascinated many of its visitors and why very few of its
        inhabitants move away.

        Brno is an important urban monument reservation and the second largest
        city in the Czech Republic. There has been continuous settlement here
        since the arrival of the Slavs in the 6th century, through the period of
        the Great Moravian Empire, and to the present day. Since the end of the
        13th century the city has been protected by the Špilberk Castle, which
        over time became the seat of the Moravian Margraves from the Luxembourg
        family and the Moravian regional capital. As with other cities, Brno has
        hidden secrets, for example the underground catacombs. For tourists from
        all over the world the greatest attraction is the Tugendhat Villa, which
        is the architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's most important European
        work, which was inscribed in the UNESCO List in 2001.

        Olomouc is a sleeper. Practically unknown outside the Czech Republic and
        underappreciated at home, the city is surprisingly majestic. The main
        square is among the country’s nicest, surrounded by historic buildings
        and blessed with a Unesco-protected trinity column. The evocative
        central streets are dotted with beautiful churches, testament to the
        city’s long history as a bastion of the Catholic church. Explore the
        foundations of ancient Olomouc Castle at the must-see Archdiocesan
        Museum, then head for one of the city’s many pubs or microbreweries,
        fuelled by the thousands of students who attend university here. Don’t
        forget to try the cheese, Olomoucký sýr or tvarůžky, reputedly the
        smelliest in the Czech Republic.
